        <h1>The Case for Synthetic Hydrocarbons</h1>
        <div class="meta">March 2025</div>
        
        <p>Here's the one-line case for synthetic hydrocarbons:</p>
        <p><strong>It's the only renewable energy carrier that can be implemented fast enough to avoid the worst
        effects of climate change without derailing human progress.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Our entire world <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy-mix" target="_blank">runs on fossil fuels</a>. The 
        <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-gdp-over-the-long-run" target="_blank">tremendous progress of human civilization over the past 100 years</a> has come as a direct consequence of our ability to dig up and use biomass
        stored in the Earth's crust in the form of coal, oil, and natural gas. All living organisms are
        composed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon" target="_blank">hydrocarbons</a>, and it's the plant/animal matter from prehistoric times that
        accumulated in deposits across the planet from millions of years of pressurization, heating, and
        sedimentation—hence the name <em>fossil</em> fuels.</p>
        
        <p>Quick chemistry discussion: Hydrocarbons are a highly reduced form of carbon. In the
        presence of oxygen and a little bit of activation energy, oxygen rips off and replaces the
        hydrogen, oxidizing the carbon in the process. This particular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox" target="_blank">redox reaction</a>, known as
        combustion, converts hydrocarbons and oxygen into carbon dioxide and water, releasing
        significant amounts of energy that is then available to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)" target="_blank">work</a>.</p>
        
        <p>CH<sub>4</sub> + 2O<sub>2</sub> → CO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O (ΔH<sub>C</sub>˚ = -891 kJ/mol)</p>
        <p><em>Combustion of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), the main component of natural gas</em></p>
        
        <p>The negative heat of combustion indicates that the products (CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O) are lower in energy
        than the reactants (CH<sub>4</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>), known as an exothermic reaction. Hydrocarbons are
        essentially solar energy stored in chemical bonds (the biomass when it was alive initially got its
        energy from photosynthesis). Through drilling and fracking, we exposed these hydrocarbons to
        oxygen (readily available in our atmosphere), releasing the stored solar energy. This has been
        an incredible boon. Fossil fuel combustion spins <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_cycle_power_plant" target="_blank">turbines</a> to provide electricity, powers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine" target="_blank">ICEs</a> to
        transport people and goods, and heats our homes and industries. There are also many
        non-combustion use cases for fossil fuels, including as reducing agents to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbothermic_reaction" target="_blank">
            process metal
            oxides into the critical metals</a> we use every day and as chemical feedstocks for plastics,
        lubricants, adhesives, asphalt, dyes, detergents, and many more products upon which we rely.</p>
        
        <p>Fossil fuels have lifted <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-in-extreme-poverty-absolute" target="_blank">many people out of poverty</a> and produced incredible wealth that would
        have been inconceivable centuries and even decades ago. Rightly, petroleum discovery and
        utilization are considered one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academy_of_Engineering#Greatest_Engineering_Achievements_of_the_20th_Century" target="_blank">greatest engineering achievements of the 20th century</a>.</p>
        
        <p>There's just one problem: they're finite resources whose use drastically impacts the Earth.</p>
        
        <p>This conflict between the incredible bounties of fossil fuels and their detrimental effects on
        planetary systems is one of the defining challenges of our era. Atmospheric carbon dioxide has
        been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeling_Curve" target="_blank">steadily rising</a> since our use of fossil fuels, and its propensity to 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect" target="_blank">trap heat on the Earth's surface</a> has caused a corresponding <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature" target="_blank">increase in global average surface temperature</a>. While it's
        <em>unclear</em> how exactly this temperature increase will manifest, we do know that it's causing an
        imbalance in our geosystem that has led to rising sea levels, more natural disasters, and
        decreased biodiversity, among other issues. And because these systems are interlinked, we're
        observing a snowball effect that <a href="https://archive.org/details/how-to-avoid-a-climate-disaster-by-bill-gates-book-drive.com/mode/2up" target="_blank">punishes the poorest people in the world who cannot adapt</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Furthermore, fossil fuels are inherently limited resources. While estimates for years of global
        fossil fuel reserves left vary, current predictions give <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/years-of-fossil-fuel-reserves-left" target="_blank">
            oil and gas about 60 years and coal about
            150 years</a>. Although, to be fair, we have historically been quite poor at estimating reserves.
        Nevertheless, the point remains that the fuels upon which we so heavily depend will run out
        sometime in the future, at which point we will need to transition anyway. Why not do it now
        when that transition could also save the climate?</p>
        
        <p>Given these effects, many policymakers have proposed rapid decarbonization as an
        uncomfortable but necessary means to mitigate climate change. The inconvenient truth that
        gets left out in these discussions, however, is the massive impoverishment such climate
        policies would induce. Our society's entire industrial stack has been designed for
        hydrocarbons, so artificially constraining their use via taxes and regulation would have
        immeasurable downstream effects on economic productivity. Even if we assume that the
        richest countries can afford to limit fossil fuel usage, it is morally corrupt to deny developing
        nations a chance at building wealth through a hydrocarbon-based economy. Those who
        suggest that we can simply switch off fossil fuels quickly have a tenuous grasp of the role
        hydrocarbons play in our society and the economic benefit of leveraging cheap energy.</p>
        
        <p>This problem would be unsolvable if it weren't for one important development: the rapid cost
        decline of solar photovoltaics (PV).</p>
        
        <p>Fossil fuels are no longer the cheapest way to obtain energy; that title belongs to solar PV and
        wind. More importantly, <a href="my-big-bet.html" target="_blank">solar PV will experience swift price decreases</a> from innovation on cells,
        manufacturing, and installation, while fossil fuels will slowly increase in cost as supply dwindles
        and convenient reserves are tapped out. We're already seeing this play out with accelerating
        installed capacity: in 2024, we added solar PV at a rate of <a href="https://www.pv-tech.org/world-adds-553gw-solar-capacity-2024-energy-demand-grows/" target="_blank">1 MW <em>every minute</em></a>!</p>
        
        <p>End use of solar electricity will no doubt be an important part of the future, but the most
        impactful role solar will play will be converting its low-cost, green electrons into value-added
        products that can be easily integrated into our existing industrial stack. The most important
        among these products is hydrocarbons.</p>
        
        <p>Similar to how fossil fuels are solar energy stored in chemical bonds, we can run the reverse
        combustion process to convert CO<sub>2</sub> and water into hydrocarbons and oxygen by supplying
        energy from solar. This is how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis" target="_blank">plants work</a>, although there are many other catalytic pathways to
        achieving this overall reaction!</p>
        
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabatier_reaction" target="_blank">This isn't a novel idea</a>, but historically, the challenge with synthesizing hydrocarbons this way
        has been that the intense energy requirements could not be satisfied in a way that was
        economically competitive with fracking. This process is only about 25-30% efficient, meaning
        most of the inputted solar energy gets wasted as heat. The key unlock now is that solar is
        rapidly approaching the cost threshold (~$10/MWh) when this process would be economically
        competitive. Essentially, the gap between the price of solar and a comparable unit of oil/natural
        gas needs to be large enough such that the cost hit of lossily converting this cheap electricity
        into hydrocarbons is negligible. This is a tall task given how inexpensive fracking is, but solar is
        on its way. The right way for this kind of process (or any commodity production) to take
        maximum advantage of cheap solar is to minimize CAPEX and adapt to the intermittency.
        Margins are brutal for commodities, so they have no room for extraneous costs. Batteries are
        too expensive to justify the extra runtime (the final product is too cheap to recoup costs), and
        the lower efficiency from a low-CAPEX process is well worth the cost savings.</p>
        
        <h2>FAQs:</h2>
        
        <h3>How is this carbon neutral?</h3>
        <p>All the carbon that goes into synthetic fuels comes from the atmosphere. When these fuels are
        then combusted, they return the same amount of carbon in the form of carbon dioxide back
        into the atmosphere, completing the cycle. The problem with fossil fuels is that they take
        carbon that was stored in the Earth's crust and put it into the atmosphere with no way of
        capturing that carbon dioxide. This net flux causes the atmospheric carbon dioxide
        accumulation we see today. In the case of synthetic fuels, no new carbon is released to the air.</p>
        
        <h3>If converting solar into hydrocarbons is inefficient, why not directly use the electricity?</h3>
        <p>Electricity is a higher-grade energy source than chemical fuels, so we will eventually electrify
        many of our current energy use cases. However, this will take lots of time and innovation since
        electrification needs to beat hydrocarbon-based processes that have been optimized over the
        past century. Even if all end uses were to be magically electrified tomorrow, that still doesn't
        address the fossil fuel-powered uses that already exist. These legacy processes, along with
        hard-to-electrify sectors, will need a carbon-neutral fuel.</p>
        
        <p>We have much better infrastructure to store, use, and transport hydrocarbons than electricity
        itself. Power grids are notoriously difficult and expensive to build out. Instead of changing the
        countless end uses of energy, synthetic hydrocarbons can be easily dropped into existing
        infrastructure and automatically make every end use carbon-neutral. An interesting corollary of
        this setup is that gas pipelines and oil tankers would effectively serve as batteries, allowing
        intermittent solar to be cheaply stored. Lithium-ion batteries are obviously more efficient and
        will be cheap, but it's convenient to have a backwards-compatible fuel that does not depend
        on massive upgrades and expansion to a weak grid.</p>
        
        <h3>Why not store the captured CO<sub>2</sub> instead of wasting energy to convert it to fuel?</h3>
        <p>From an environmental perspective, this idea makes sense, and indeed, we will likely need
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage" target="_blank">carbon capture and storage</a> as long as we keep using fossil fuels. The challenge is economic
        since CO<sub>2</sub> itself has no intrinsic utility (hence why we dispose it into the atmosphere for free).
        Carbon markets are attempts at artificially injecting value, but not only are they <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/explained-carbon-credits-0228" target="_blank">
            difficult to
            regulate</a>, they will become obsolete if there's a more economically productive thing to do with
        the captured carbon.</p>
        
        <h3>Why not hydrogen or other energy carriers?</h3>
        <p>Again, infrastructure. While it is true that solar energy can be stored in different chemical
        bonds, we already know how to handle hydrocarbons as well as any other molecule. Hydrogen
        is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_embrittlement" target="_blank">extremely challenging to store and transport</a>, and ammonia is toxic. All our end uses are
        expecting hydrocarbons anyway, so why not supply that?</p>
        
        <h3>Will this ruin the balance of CO<sub>2</sub>?</h3>
        <p>This is a bit more forward-thinking concern. If synthetic hydrocarbons were to completely
        replace fossil fuels, then the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration would start to decrease, since
        some percentage of the carbon will turn into plastics, adhesives, lubricants, etc., that won't
        return to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide again. The planet needs some amount of carbon
        dioxide to retain heat and prevent an ice age, so technically we do run the risk of having too
        little CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere if this process were to scale. Pre-industrial concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>
        was around <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co2-long-term-concentration" target="_blank">280-300 ppm</a> (right now we're at 420 ppm), so in this hypothetical future, we could
        monitor levels until we reach this threshold, at which point we would either phase out these
        solar-to-fuels plants or encourage fossil fuel use. What a problem that would be!</p>
        
        <h3>What markets would benefit the most from synthetic hydrocarbons?</h3>
        <p>The short answer is any sector that relies on them today because they aren't easily electrified. I
        think the most important of these is aviation. Small-distance vehicles like cars and buses will
        reasonably be electrified in the future, but flight specifically has much to gain from having
        cheap access to chemically dense fuels. Weight and volume are at a premium in the aviation
        industry, meaning each unit of your fuel needs to carry more bang for its buck. Kerosene has
        an energy density of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density" target="_blank">43 MJ/kg</a>, whereas lithium-ion batteries have an energy density of ~1
        MJ/kg. Even with the 2x efficiency boost from using an electric motor versus a gas turbine,
        batteries will struggle to compete with traditional jet fuel. Hydrogen has great gravimetric
        density but terrible volumetric density, meaning that it too won't be able to replace
        long-distance aviation. Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) that are compatible with existing jet
        engines will be the only reasonable way to "decarbonize" all aviation.</p>
        
        <p>Hydrocarbons are not inherently bad; we just need to close the carbon cycle instead of letting
        carbon dioxide build up in the atmosphere. Fuels synthesized from cheap solar power will allow
        us to continue progressing as a civilization without making the planet uninhabitable. Solar
        resources are much more distributed across the world as compared to fossil fuels, meaning
        nations could power their own industries without relying as heavily on foreign imports. This has
        massive consequences for geopolitics and international trade, as wars that are fought over
        energy resources would diminish.</p>
        
        <p>Our society is at its best when we let the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand" target="_blank">invisible hand</a> of free markets drive progress, as
        opposed to regulations, subsidies, and taxes that artificially constrain competition. The answer
        to climate change is not making hydrocarbons more expensive to use through regulation, but
        less expensive to use through technological innovation. Within the next 5 years, solar will reach
        the point when fuels synthesized from its energy will be cheaper than their fossil counterparts,
        delivering a green dividend that continues to grow human prosperity. By then, we'll consider it
        barbaric that we even dug holes in the ground to get something as fundamental as energy.</p>
